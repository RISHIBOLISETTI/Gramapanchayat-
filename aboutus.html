River Godavari inspired Adikavi Nannayya (First poet in Telugu Language ) to undertake translation of Vyasa Mahabharata into Telugu from the Sanskrit original. It was not a mere translation. It was transcreation Nannayya very wisely borrowed the storyline and the ideas from the original and wrote in his own idiomatic way. But unfortunately he died after finishing 21/2 cantos (parvas), Yerrapragada completed the remaining parva closely following parvas in his won imitable style. This poetic trinity is held in high esteem by later poets. Scholar poet Srinadha also lived for many years at Rajahmundry.

The very sight of river Godavari makes one poetical and lyrical. Many imaginative directors like Bapu captured the beauty of Godavari on the celluloid.
A boat ride on the Godavari on a cool tranquil moonlit night is a thrilling and everlasting experience.
